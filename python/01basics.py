# ! Python Identifiers
x = 1
'''
A Python identifier is a name used to identify a *variable*, *function*, *class*, *module* or other object.
An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters,
underscores(_) and digits (0 to 9).

Python does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers.
Python is a *case sensitive* programming language.
Thus, *Manpower* and *manpower* are two different identifiers in Python.
