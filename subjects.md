> ##**Overview**
> > Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language.<br>
> > Python is designed to be highly readable.<br>
> > It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.<br>
> > > ###**Python is Interpreted**<br>
> > > Python is processed at **runtime by the interpreter**. You do not need to **compile** your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.
> >
> > > ###**Python is Interactive**<br>
> > > You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the **interpreter** directly to write your programs.
> >
> > > ###**Python is Object-Oriented**<br>
> > > Python supports **Object-Oriented** style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.
> >
> > > ###**Python is a Beginner's Language**<br>
> > > Python is a great language for the **beginner-level** programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.
